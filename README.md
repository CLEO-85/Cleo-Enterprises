# Cleo's Demo Site - Local Backend

This repository contains a small demo backend to test Sign In / Sign Up flows for the static site.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\USER\Desktop\new"
npm install
npm start
# Open in browser: http://localhost:3000/INDEX.html
```

Notes:
- This server is a demo only. User data is stored in memory and will be lost when the server restarts.
- Do NOT use this for production. Replace with a secure authentication backend before going live.
